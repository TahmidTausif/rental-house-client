# Rental House

A modern web application for showcasing Housing listings. Built with NextJS, React, Vite, Tailwind CSS on the frontend, and Node.js, Express, MongoDB on the backend.

> 📌 **Note**: This project is a customized version of a group project I previously contributed to. I cloned the original repository and redesigned the layout and styling to reflect a more modern and minimal design while maintaining the core functionality.
